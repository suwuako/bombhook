## Dependencies

 - selenium 
 - firefox
 - python
 - thats it

## TODO
- legit mode
- read rules of the game
- improve algorythm so that once max lives are reached it uses shorter words 
- fix a nasty workaround where opponent's inputs cant be read so it instead checks if your input fails 
- tell when the game ends and reset to tui or smthn
- improve angorithm to give points to letters to instead prioritse higher ranked letters which might be less common such as (x, z) 
- maybe add gui?
- idk dm me if u have any ideas
