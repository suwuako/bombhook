## How to get it working and stuff

1. install python if you havent already @ https://www.python.org/ 
2. git clone this repository or download as zip 
3. run dependencies.bat or dependencies.sh depending if ur on windows or linux
4. run main.py either from console or right clicking and click run with idle

## TODO
~~- check if it works for windows & linux~~
- legit mode - current WIP
~~- read full rules of the game~~
- improve algorythm so that once max lives are reached it uses shorter words 
- fix a nasty workaround where opponent's inputs cant be read so it instead checks if your input fails 
- tell when the game ends and reset to tui or smthn
- improve angorithm to give points to letters to instead prioritse higher ranked letters which might be less common such as (x, z) instead of amount of usable words - refer to <a href="https://github.com/suwuako/bombhook-word-rankings"> suwuako/bombhook-word-rankings </a>
- maybe add gui?
